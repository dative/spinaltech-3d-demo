# Spinal Tech 3D Brace Experiment

[Demo](https://dative.github.io/spinaltech-3d-demo/)

## Introduction

This repository contains the code for the Spinal Tech 3D Brace Experiment. The experiment is a web-based application that allows users to interact with a 3D scoliosis brace and preview different patterns. The application is built using the [Model Viewer](https://modelviewer.dev/) web component, which is a web component that allows users to view 3D models in the browser.

## Resources

[Blender](https://hackmd.io/@XR/webxr-workflows#Blender)
[Model Viewer Editor](https://modelviewer.dev/editor/)

## Notes

I had to create a `<canvas>` dynamically in order to make the patterns repeatable
and resizeable.

## Requirements

- [ ] Decide which brace will be the model
- [ ] Multiple picture angles of that brace with a pattern
- [ ] STL file for selected brace
- [ ] JPE of the pattern
- [ ] Create a proof of concept that will allow us to create the UI for the website
